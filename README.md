# Capital-Bikeshare-
This project is a predictive modeling exercise using Capital Bikeshare data from Feb-Apr 2024. The goal is to build models that forecast daily bike pickups and drop-offs at the "22nd &amp; H St NW" station, leveraging features like weather, day-of-week, and trip data to optimize bike/dock allocation. Includes Jupyter notebook and detailed report.
## Basic Information
* Person or organization developing model: Robert Bhero, robert.bhero@gwu.edu 
* Model date: June 2025
* Model version: 1.0
* License: MIT
* Model implementation:
## Intended Use
* Primary intended uses: This project serves as an educational example of applying machine learning models to forecast daily bike pickups and drop-offs at Capital Bikeshare's "22nd & H St NW" station, using features like weather, day-of-week, and trip data from Feb-Apr 2024. It is intended to demonstrate the comparison and application of various predictive models, such as Random Forest, Neural Network, KNN and Regression Tree, for optimizing resource allocation in urban transportation systems.
* Primary intended users: Students and those that want to learn about modeling
* Out of scope use cases: Any use beyond an educational example is out of scope
