# Capital-Bikeshare-
This project is a predictive modeling exercise using Capital Bikeshare data from Feb-Apr 2024. The goal is to build models that forecast daily bike pickups and drop-offs at the "22nd &amp; H St NW" station, leveraging features like weather, day-of-week, and trip data to optimize bike/dock allocation. Includes Jupyter notebook and detailed report.
